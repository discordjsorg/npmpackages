## Features

Works both in Node.js and in the browser
If a number is supplied to ms, a string with a unit is returned
If a string that contains the number is supplied, it returns it as a number (e.g.: it returns 100 for '100')
If you pass a string with a number and a valid unit, the number of equivalent milliseconds is returned

## Caught a Bug?

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device
2. Link the package to the global module directory: npm link
3. Within the module you want to test your local development instance of ms, just link it to the dependencies: npm link ms. Instead of the default one from npm, Node.js will now use your clone of ms!
